# Sys_I_projects
All projects related to Systems I that I worked on during my OSU CSE Systems I course 

## Folder structures note
- During this course our professor wanted us to understand how header files were structured
- So most folders have a large amount of files that could be combined into relative files rather than
- being separate files. I just never got around to this

## Known bugs
- Lab 3 has a few bugs as I was not familiar with pointers at the time of writing it
- Primarily when creating and deleting new "folders"
